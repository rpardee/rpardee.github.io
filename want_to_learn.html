              <li>
                HTML / CSS
                <p>The little bit I've done with Ruby on Rails was an opportunity to delve into HTML as a spec/standard/language.  I love HTML as a medium for written expression&mdash;tend to be quite digressive and referential in my writing and I love how I can drop clues or actual links to my references without having to interrupt the flow.</p>
                <p>This site is actually an opportunity for me to dip a toe back into these waters, though I must confess that I am cheating a bit by using the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a> framework.</p>
              </li>
              <li><a href="http://r-project.org">R</a>
                <p>Ever since reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Data-William-S-Cleveland/dp/0963488406/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1378585665&sr=8-2&keywords=visualizing+datas">Visualizing Data by William Cleveland</a> in graduate school I've wanted to learn s-plus (now R) in order to produce those insanely gorgeous/informative displays.  "Tools matter" indeed.  I spend so much of my time in SAS that I haven't had sufficient prodding to actually try to use R for real, but I would dearly love the opportunity.</p>
              </li>
              <li>javascript + jQuery
                <p>This pretty much goes with the HTML/CSS territory.  Can't do fun webby things without javascript, and near as I can tell, jquery seems to be the app framework that's sticking around.  I've read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/jQuery-Action-Bear-Bibeault/dp/1933988355/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1378586485&sr=8-3&keywords=jquery+manning">jQuery In Action</a> and played around a bit, but it's powerful unnatural stuff.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Machine learning / Natural Language Processing
                <p>Working on the <a href="troll_path.rb.html">pathology report text classifier</a> we used on a study to do rapid cancer case ascertainment was an absolute blast, and whet my appetite for getting further in to that.  Long ago at work I was going to be part of the NLP group, but a competing opportunity came up (VDW Co-Lead position) and I didn't have time.</p>
              </li>
              <li><a href="http://python.org">Python</a>
                <p>This one isn't so much an "OMG I wish I could do that!" as it is a means to the end of being able to use/extend/tweak software written in python. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/rpardee/sas.tmbundle">my Sublime Text package for SAS Programming</a> would really benefit from a better knowledge of python.</p>
