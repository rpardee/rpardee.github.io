            <p>Led the technical aspects of the HMO Research Network's VDW Operations Committee, including the VDW Implementation Group. This work involved:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>designing a process for evaluating and deciding on more than 100 proposed changes to the VDW dataset specifications, </li>
              <li>grouping the approved changes into "milestones" and negotiating timelines with staff charged with implementing those changes at 15 different HMOs, </li>
              <li>devising an objective, test-based process for sites to demonstrate their milestone achievements, coordinating the activity of the numerous workgroups who created the test programs,</li>
              <li>documenting each milestone, and communicating site progress both to users and to the HMORN Asset Stewardship Committee, and</li>
              <li>supporting users during the transition. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Introduced and promoted several software engineering tools/practices to the community of VDW implementers&mdash;specifically, source code control, formal issue tracking, and the use of objective, automated quality assurance testing. Worked with the Asset Stewardship and Governing Board of the HMORN to enable open issue tracking (a significant political achievement).</p>

          <div class="col-md-7">
            <p>Provided technical leadership for a distributed team of analysts creating and exploiting a cross-site Virtual Data Warehouse&mdash;a federated health services database with a common query interface (in the form of SAS programs). Devised methods for standardizing and sharing com-mon program elements in the form of SAS macros, and wrote a large number of those macros (e.g. for evaluating continuous enrollment, text processing for names and addresses). Maintained Group Health's VDW datasets. Served as project programmer for numerous, concurrently run multi-site studies, negotiating requirements and timelines for cohort extractions, designing cross-site data flows, and creating tracking databases. Designed, implemented and supported a generalized study subject tracking system, with a data/event driven architecture sufficiently flexible to support many diverse studies without the need for reprogramming.</p>
