Because we sometimes see seemingly contradictory responses in raw data for individual patients (e.g., Straight (not lesbian or gay) and Gay) it was (and remains) puzzling how these responses can be understood.</p><p>Since our 2019 effort to get a handle on SOGI data, we have come to realize that this information is worth adding even given the occasional ambiguous response. The vast majority of responding patients give a single, easily-understood response.</p><p>Because of this ambiguity, we make no representation with respect to the ordering of values in the 3 sexual_orientation columns. They may or may not represent an ordering in time of the patient/member's understanding of their orientation. They may or may not represent the patient's relative preference ranking of the orientation descriptions.</p><p>Note that our collective understanding of human sexuality, both in Medicine and in the larger culture is currently rather volatile. The scheme proposed here is the superset of all values actually observed at our member organizations as we propose this variable. Users should be aware that, like the rest of the SOGI data in Demographics, we expect these variables to be sparsely populated. In particular, the values beyond the HRSA recommendations (Asexual, Pansexual, Queer) have only been observed at one organization and so will be exceedingly rare.</p>"

There are two major implications of this internal/external distinction. <p>First, health plans typically have more control on the type, volume, quality, and cost of care at the facilities that they own and/or operate.  There is a stronger incentive to provide efficient care and providers at these facilities probably have access to more complete patient information. Health plans typically have less control over external facilities.  These external facilities often have different incentives and thus, care patterns may be different.   For instance, the mom delivery C-section rate may be different at owned hospitals as compared to external hospitals.  Despite the disadvantages, it's also possible that patients may receive better care at an external facility (the specialty group with the best reputation in the service area may be at an external facility).</p><p>Second, facility locations indicated on incoming claims may only include the billing location--where payment should be submited.</p>"
