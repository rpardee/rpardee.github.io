There are two major implications of this internal/external distinction. <p>First, health plans typically have more control on the type, volume, quality, and cost of care at the facilities that they own and/or operate.  There is a stronger incentive to provide efficient care and providers at these facilities probably have access to more complete patient information. Health plans typically have less control over external facilities.  These external facilities often have different incentives and thus, care patterns may be different.   For instance, the mom delivery C-section rate may be different at owned hospitals as compared to external hospitals.  Despite the disadvantages, it's also possible that patients may receive better care at an external facility (the specialty group with the best reputation in the service area may be at an external facility).</p><p>Second, facility locations indicated on incoming claims may only include the billing location--where payment should be submited.</p>"
