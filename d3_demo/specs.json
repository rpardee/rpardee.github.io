There is a stronger incentive to provide efficient care and providers at these facilities probably have access to more complete patient information. Health plans typically have less control over external facilities.  These external facilities often have different incentives and thus, care patterns may be different.   For instance, the mom delivery C-section rate may be different at owned hospitals as compared to external hospitals.
