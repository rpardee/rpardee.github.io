            <h2>The <abbr title="Too long&mdash;didn't read">TL;DR</abbr></h2>
            <p>I am smart enough to pick things up quickly, confident enough to admit when I don't know something, and have perspective enough not to fuss over details that won't matter to an end result.</p>
            <h2>Generally</h2>
            <p>My primary strength is my ability to understand complex systems, exploit the data they leave behind, and explain them to others.  That applies both to systems that I had a hand in designing (e.g., the <abbr title="HMORN Virtual Data Warehouse">VDW</abbr>) and those designed by others--like for instance the Epic <abbr title="Electronic Medical Record">EMR</abbr>.</p>
            <p>I've been programming a long time now--more than 15 years at this writing, and I tend to have strong opinions about how to get things done.  When met with resistance from collegues, I have had excellent luck swaying others to my point of view.</p>
            <p>I'd <strong>like</strong> to think this indicates a certain amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_authority">natural authority</a>.  Possibly I'm deluding myself.</p>
            <p>Another benefit of my experience is that it's made me confident enough to admit when I don't know something.  I'm also not shy about looking like a fool asking questions.  Sometimes this sheds light on the sketchy parts of an explanation, sometimes I'm asking what most everybody else in the room is silently wondering, and sometimes I just look like a fool.</p>
            <h2>Technical Things</h2>
            <p>My technical strengths tend to center around the design, management and exploitation of data, in its various forms.</p>  
            <p>Specifically, I am very good at:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>, both the <abbr title="Data Definition Language">DDL</abbr> and <abbr title="Data Manipulation">DML</abbr> varieties.  I have pretty extensive experience using the dialects offered by SAS, <abbr title="Microsoft SQL Server">MSSQL</abbr>, Oracle, Sybase and Teradata.</li>
              <li>
                SAS, including especially:
                <ul>
                  <li>Base</li>
                  <li>Datastep</li>
                  <li>Macro</li>
                  <li>Graph</li>
                </ul>
                I have done a lot of SAS programming for things that have to run at other organizations, which has has led me to be extra careful, and to write more for a human audience and less just for git'-r-done. 
              </li>
              <li>Ruby, which I love and has probably ruined me for other languages.  The bulk of my work has been data-munging and data transfer scripting.  I did complete one Ruby on Rails application which was in use for more than a year, but I should not hold myself out as a Rails expert.</li>
              <li>Regular Expressions.</li>
              <li>Data visualization, particularly with SAS' new Statistical Graphics procedures (see, e.g., <a href="http://implementing-vdw.blogspot.com/2012/11/cool-new-lab-results-data-visualization.html">this Lab data visualization I put together with PROC SGRENDER</a>).</li>
              <li>Data analysis, both descriptive and (to a lesser extent) inferential.  I tend to rely much more on visualization&mdash;resorting to e.g., significance testing usually means I'm desperate to convince you of something and couldn't come up with a convincing graphic.</li>
              <li>Microsoft Access application programming.  I have put together many a data-entry (and in a couple of cases, full chart abstraction applications) application.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I am decent at:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>.Net programming&mdash;primarily Windows Forms (are those still in use?) but also some ASP.net.  I used to be very good at these&mdash;and could probably come back up to speed reasonably quickly.  I'm just rusty.</li>
              <li>Python</li>
              <li>HTML/CSS</li>
              <li>Git.  
              <p>I led a reasonably successful campaign to get the SAS programmers at GHRI to use source code control generally, and git specifically.  So I'm a fan and git has saved my bacon on more than one occasion.  That said, a cursory browse through my github will probably tell the sophisticated git user that I am a noobie.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Substantive Expertise</h2>
            <p>Having worked in a medical/health insurance setting for more than ten years now, I have picked up some modest knowledge of things like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Health insurance plans.</li>
              <li>Cancer (tumor) data.</li>
              <li>Professional and Institutional Claims data.</li>
              <li>ICD-9 (soon to be 10) CPT, HCPCS coding systems.</li>
              <li>The Epic EMR and associated Clarity reporting database.</li>
              <li>Clinical lab data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But mostly I've learned that I don't know very much about these things, and have come to rely on the various medical experts I work for and with.</p>
            <p>My stint at Lockheed-Martin Missles &amp; Space was similarly enlightening about all sorts of Military things, but I don't remember any of it (and if I could, I couldn't tell you what it was ;-).</p>
